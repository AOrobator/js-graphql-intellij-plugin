# This is a default empty schema.

# Feel free to delete this file and use multiple .graphql files to describe your schema.
# You can also declare your schema inside a number of .graphql and .gql tagged templates in JavaScript and TypeScript.
#
# See https://graphql.org/learn/schema/ for how to describe the types in your schema.
#
# Edit the graphql.config.json file to add your endpoint location to be able to query from .graphql files.
#
# If your project contains multiple schemas, you can keep them separate by configuring custom scopes under
# "Settings" > "Appearance & Behavior" > "Scopes".
